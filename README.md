FilePermissionsProject
## Project Introduction
In this project, I demonstrate my proficiency in using Linux commands to manage file permissions. This includes checking details of files and directories, interpreting permissions strings, changing file and directory permissions, and handling hidden files. These skills are crucial for ensuring appropriate access controls in a secure environment.
## Modeling and Evaluation
- **Commands Used**: `ls -la`, `chmod`, `chown`
- **Evaluation**: Ensured appropriate file and directory permissions, verified changes using `ls -la`
## Conclusion
Managing file permissions is essential for maintaining the security and organization of the file system. This project demonstrates the practical use of Linux commands to achieve this goal. Future steps include automating permission checks using scripts.
